# FindSimulator

## Overview
Use simctl to find UDIDs of Xcode simulators to be used as 'destination' parameter in xcodebuild.

Just get the ID of the first available simulator, which matches the query.
Speify whether to search for 'iOS', 'watchOS' or 'tvOS' simulators. You can also specify a major and minor version of the OS, you want to target or specify 'latest' to get the latest and greatest.

There is also an option to list all matches along with their names.

You can also find iPhone simulators with paired watches.

## How to use it
The tool doesn't create any file. It justs outputs its results to standard out.
You can store the result in a shell variable:
```
simulator_id=$(findsimulator -o ios -m latest iPhone)
xcrun xcodebuild test -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace -scheme MyApp -destination "id=$simulator_id"
```

## How to get it
### Using homebrew
```
brew tap a7ex/homebrew-formulae
brew install findsimulator
```
### Download binary
- Download `findsimulator.zip` binary from the latest [release](https://github.com/a7ex/FindSimulator/releases/latest)
- Copy `findsimulator` to your desktop
- Open a Terminal window and run this command to give the app permission to execute:

```
chmod +x ~/Desktop/findsimulator
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This binary is not notarized/certified by Apple yet. So you must go to SystemSettings:Security and explicitely allow the app to execute, after the first attempt to launch it in the terminal, in case you want to take the risk.


Or build the tool yourself:

- Clone the repository / Download the source code
- Run `swift build -c release` to build `findsimulator` executable
- Run `open .build/release` to open directory containing the executable file in Finder
- Drag `findsimulator` executable from the Finder window to your desktop

## How to install it
### Using homebrew
```
brew tap a7ex/homebrew-formulae
brew install findsimulator
```
### Downloaded binary
Assuming that the `findsimulator` app is on your desktopâ€¦

Open a Terminal window and run this command:
```
cp ~/Desktop/findsimulator /usr/local/bin/
```
Verify `findsimulator` is in your search path by running this in Terminal:
```
findsimulator -h
```
You should see the tool respond like this:
